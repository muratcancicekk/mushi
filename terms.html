        <h1>Terms of Use for Mushi</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Last Updated: July 8, 2025</p>

        <p>Please read these Terms of Use ("Terms", "Terms of Use") carefully before using the "Mushi" mobile application (the "App") operated by Murat Can Çiçek ("us", "we", or "our").</p>

        <p>Your access to and use of the App is conditioned on your acceptance of and compliance with these Terms. These Terms apply to all visitors, users, and others who access or use the App.</p>

        <p>By accessing or using the App, you agree to be bound by these Terms. If you disagree with any part of the terms, then you may not access the App.</p>

        <h2>1. Services</h2>
        <p>The "Mushi" App is designed to help users identify insects by taking or uploading photos. The App uses advanced artificial intelligence (Google's Gemini API) to analyze images and provide information about identified insects, including their common name, scientific name, description, habitat, life cycle, and other relevant details. The App also allows users to store their identification history and ask follow-up questions about identified insects.</p>

        <h2>2. Accuracy of Information</h2>
        <p>While we strive to provide accurate and up-to-date information, the insect identification and information provided by the App are based on artificial intelligence analysis. This technology is constantly evolving, but may not always be 100% accurate. Therefore:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>The App's identification results should be used for informational purposes only.</li>
            <li>We do not guarantee the absolute accuracy, completeness, or reliability of any information provided.</li>
            <li>Do not rely on the App for critical decisions, especially regarding harmful insects or health-related matters. Always consult with a professional entomologist or pest control expert for definitive identification or advice regarding potentially dangerous insects.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>3. Subscriptions and Payments</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>The App offers a limited number of free identifications. To access unlimited identifications and other premium features, you may purchase a subscription through Apple's App Store.</li>
            <li>Subscriptions are managed directly through your Apple App Store account. All payments are processed by Apple.</li>
            <li>For information regarding subscription plans, pricing, cancellation, and refunds, please refer to Apple's App Store terms and conditions.</li>
            <li>We use Adapty as our subscription infrastructure provider.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. User Content</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When you use the App to identify insects, you may submit images. By submitting images, you grant us a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, reproduce, modify, adapt, publish, translate, create derivative works from, distribute, and display such images solely for the purpose of providing and improving the App's services to you.</li>
            <li>You represent and warrant that you own or have the necessary licenses, rights, consents, and permissions to submit any images you provide to the App.</li>
            <li>You agree not to submit any content that is illegal, offensive, harmful, infringing, or otherwise violates these Terms.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>5. Prohibited Uses</h2>
        You agree not to use the App:
        <ul>
            <li>In any way that violates any applicable national, state, local, or international law or regulation.</li>
            <li>For the purpose of exploiting, harming, or attempting to exploit or harm minors in any way.</li>
            <li>To transmit, or procure the sending of, any advertising or promotional material without our prior written consent, including any "junk mail," "chain letter," "spam," or any other similar solicitation.</li>
            <li>To impersonate or attempt to impersonate Murat Can Çiçek, a Murat Can Çiçek employee, another user, or any other person or entity.</li>
            <li>To engage in any other conduct that restricts or inhibits anyone's use or enjoyment of the App, or which, as determined by us, may harm Murat Can Çiçek or users of the App or expose them to liability.</li>
            <li>To attempt to circumvent any free scan limitations or subscription paywalls.</li>
        </ul>
